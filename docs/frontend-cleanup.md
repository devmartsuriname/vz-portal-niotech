## Separation of Concerns

### Public Frontend (Niotech Template)
- **Path:** `/` (root)
- **Layout:** Layout4 (Header4 + Footer)
- **Pages:** 8 production pages
- **Authentication:** None required
- **Purpose:** Public-facing marketing and information
- **Technology:** React + React Router + Bootstrap

### Admin Backend (Darkone Template)
- **Path:** `/admin`
- **Layout:** AdminLayout (Darkone theme)
- **Pages:** Dashboard, Auth, Settings
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (required)
- **Purpose:** Internal administration
- **Technology:** React + Bootstrap 5 + ApexCharts

**Note:** These two systems coexist but remain architecturally separate.
