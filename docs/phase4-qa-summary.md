   - Phase 3 delivered **8-9 documents per type** (100 total mappings)
   - All 12 application types fully populated ✅
   - 31 wizard rules active and correctly configured ✅

2. **Backend Architecture Solid**
   - All RLS policies in place and verified ✅
   - Storage bucket `submission-files` configured correctly ✅
   - Edge Functions deployed and active (4 functions) ✅
   - Secrets configured (Resend API key) ✅

3. **Component Rendering Verified**

### ⚠️ Areas Requiring Manual Testing

1. **Wizard User Flow (TS-01 to TS-04)**
   - Need human tester to complete full wizard flows
   - Verify: Question navigation, answer selection, evaluation logic
   - Measure: API response times (<500ms target)
   - Capture: Screenshots of each step

2. **File Upload Functionality (TS-06)**
   - Current test submission has 0 files uploaded
   - Need to test: File validation (size, type), upload process, storage
   - Verify: Error messages display correctly
   - Check: Files appear in Supabase Storage bucket

3. **Admin UI Operations (TS-07, TS-08)**
   - Need admin login to test CRUD operations
   - Verify: Create, Read, Update, Delete for wizard rules and document mappings
   - Test: Filters, search, pagination (if applicable)
   - Check: Optimistic updates and error handling

4. **Email Delivery (TS-09)**
   - Need to complete a submission to trigger email
   - Verify: Email received in inbox
   - Check: Resend dashboard for delivery confirmation
   - Test: Status update notification emails

### 🔴 Potential Issues (Not Confirmed)

**No critical issues identified yet.** The following are areas to watch during manual testing:

1. **File Upload Missing from Test Submission**
   - Test submission `3cfc9e3b` has 0 files
   - Could indicate: User skipped file upload, or upload failed silently
   - **Action:** Prioritize TS-06 file upload testing

2. **Performance Not Yet Measured**
   - Wizard page load time: Target <1.5s (not measured)
   - evaluate-wizard API: Target <500ms (not measured)
   - File upload: Target <2s for 1MB file (not measured)
   - **Action:** Use Chrome DevTools Network tab during manual testing

3. **Browser Compatibility Unknown**
   - Only default browser (likely Chrome) verified so far
   - Safari, Firefox, Edge not yet tested
   - Mobile responsiveness not verified
   - **Action:** Test on all 4 major browsers per Phase 4 plan
