## üéØ Testing Instructions for You

### Step 1: Review Documentation
Read through the following documents in order:
1. `/docs/qa-testing-checklist.md` ‚Äî Your main testing guide
2. `/docs/accessibility-testing-guide.md` ‚Äî Accessibility testing instructions
3. `/docs/bug-tracking-template.md` ‚Äî For reporting any issues found

### Step 2: Perform Manual Testing
Follow the checklist in `qa-testing-checklist.md`:

**Day 1 Focus:**
- Test all 7 admin modules systematically
- Check frontend features (Vergunningen, Wizard)
- Verify form submissions and data flow
- Test CRUD operations on all entities

**Day 2 Focus:**
- Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test on different devices (phone, tablet, desktop)
- Verify RLS policies by creating test users
- Run Lighthouse audits and document scores

### Step 3: Document Issues
Use the bug tracking template for any issues:
```markdown
**Bug ID:** BUG-001
**Title:** [Descriptive title]
**Severity:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Module:** [Which page/feature]
**Steps to Reproduce:** [Numbered steps]
```

### Step 4: Run Lighthouse Audits
For each page listed in the checklist:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Lighthouse tab
3. Select all categories
4. Click "Analyze page load"
5. Document scores in checklist

Target Scores:
- Performance: ‚â• 90
- Accessibility: ‚â• 95
- Best Practices: ‚â• 95
- SEO: ‚â• 90

### Step 5: Security Testing
**Test RLS Policies:**
1. Create 2 test users (User A and User B)
2. Log in as User A, create a submission
3. Log out and log in as User B
4. Verify User B cannot see User A's submission
5. Repeat for all protected tables

**Test Admin Access:**
1. Log in as regular user
2. Try to access `/admin/dashboard` (should redirect)

## üí° Tips for Effective Testing

### Best Practices
1. **Test Systematically:** Follow the checklist in order
2. **Document Everything:** Screenshot issues immediately
3. **Test Edge Cases:** Try unusual inputs, empty states
4. **Think Like Users:** Would a real user struggle with this?
5. **Test Both Happy and Error Paths:** Success and failure scenarios
6. **Verify Real-time Updates:** Test with multiple tabs open
7. **Clear Cache Between Tests:** Ensure fresh data loads

### Common Issues to Watch For
- Empty states (no data)
- Loading states (slow connections)
- Error messages (failed API calls)
- Form validation (missing required fields)
- Responsive layouts (broken on mobile)
- Browser-specific bugs (Safari quirks)
- Security gaps (unauthorized access)
